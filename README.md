# Java Assignment: Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface

This repository demonstrates the differences between Concrete Classes, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces in Java.

## Structure:
- **Animal (Interface)**: Defines an abstract method `makeSound()`.
- **Mammal (Abstract Class)**: Implements `Animal`, provides a concrete `sleep()` method, and an abstract `eat()` method.
- **Dog (Concrete Class)**: Implements all abstract methods and adds extra functionality.

## How to Run:
  Install Java Development Kit (JDk)
  in the terminal compile the code using the javac command to compile your code in the terminal( javac Main.java )
  run the compiled code (java Main )
